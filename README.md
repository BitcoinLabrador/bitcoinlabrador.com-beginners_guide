# bitcoinlabrador.com - The Beginners' Guide

Getting started with bitcoin can be quite daunting. With this website, I'll be try to explain some imporant topics in bite-sized chunks, using simple language.

The beginners' guide will consist of a few sections. Every section will have a short read (about 5 minutes), summarizing the general idea of that section. It'll have further reading available at the end of the section, which will consist of the articles that inspired me for that section.

1. Why bitcoin?
I'll start with the why, because I feel that is the most important part about bitcoin. This part will be based on the following articles (to be expanded):
- Robert Breedlove's writing, mainly https://medium.com/@breedlove22/masters-and-slaves-of-money-255ecc93404f
- Why Bitcoin by Wiz https://medium.com/@wiz/why-bitcoin-359ada12629e
- Some general knowledge by Bitcoin Q&A https://www.bitcoinqna.com/

2. How to get bitcoin
Next up will be the how, because it's important to have skin in the game. I'll give some explanation of where you can get it in multiple countries, what to avoid, and why you should buy your bitcoin KYC-free

3. What is bitcoin?
What bitcoin is and how it works is a much more optional path to take, so I'll treat that part last.
Most of this will be a very condensed version of "Inventing Bitcoin" by Yan Pritzker
